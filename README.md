# RationalReactRedux-Gen
This saves me an average of 20 - 30 minutes each time I work on a new feature. This not only has capabilities for creating new files, but also of updating old ones. Not to mention that it helps everyone stick to the same conventions and best practices.

# So far:
1. creates unit tests
2. creates HOC component
3. creates reducer
4. imports with context
5. comments for best practices
6. redux store connection to a new HOC
7. redux injection for an older HOC

Enjoy!
