# RationalReactRedux-Gen
This saves me an average of 20 - 30 minutes each time I need to stub files with imports (and boilerplate and comments) and it connects my store directly into my React components for me. This not only has capabilities for creating new files, but also of updating old ones. This also helps the team to stick to the same conventions and best practices. Enjoy!
